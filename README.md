# CLADE

C.L.A.D.E. (Criminal Locator And Discipline Enforcer) is the result of an autonomous ground robotics project for the University of Colorado, Boulder mechatronics and robotics course.

CLADE uses OpenCV with a Raspberry Pi camera and a Luxonis depth camera to autonomously navigate a scaled down version of a urban police training course "Hogan's Alley". CLADE uses four "omni-wheels" with an Arduino-based motor controller to navigate the environment and stepper motors with an additional Arduino microcontroller to control the airsoft gun turret's rotation and elevation.
